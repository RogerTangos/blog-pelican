    <p>Albert Carter is an environmental financial campaigner, programmer, engineering manager, and a director of <a href="https://bank.green">Bank.Green</a></p>
<hr>
<p>Much of my environmental work was first motivated an event in the US Gulf Coast, where I grew up. There, in 2010, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deepwater_Horizon_oil_spill">BP spilled 4.9 million barrels of oil</a>.</p>
<p>Cleanup workers <a href="https://www.thenation.com/article/archive/investigation-two-years-after-bp-spill-hidden-health-crisis-festers/">reported</a> "eye, nose and throat irritation; respiratory problems; blood in urine, vomit and rectal bleeding; seizures; nausea and violent vomiting episodes that last for hours; skin irritation, burning and lesions; short-term memory loss and confusion; liver and kidney damage; central nervous system effects and nervous system damage; hypertension; and miscarriages". It’s no surprise, given that those unemployed fishermen were sometimes <a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2010/HEALTH/05/31/oil.spill.order/index.html">not allowed to use respirators, and BP threatened to fire those that did</a>. Similarly aggressive <a href="https://www.academia.edu/12754754/BP_s_Reputation_Repair_Strategies_during_the_Gulf_Oil_Spill">reputation management tactics</a> by BP often kept such details off of search pages while <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/pda/2010/jul/23/bp-oil-spill-pictures">doctored photos</a> created the illusion that BP the spill was under control.</p>
<p>To add insult to injury, <strong>BP offered those same fishing families cheap settlements, which waived the families' rights to join class action lawsuits.</strong> Often, with hungry children at home, no more livelihood on the Gulf, and no idea of what a class action lawsuit was or when it might pay them, they accepted.</p>
<p><strong>My mother translated, interpreted, and did social work for one of the Vietnamese Gulf-coast fishing communities that BP hired to clean up.</strong> Though I had moved away for college, she shared the stories.</p>
<p><strong>Learning about the tragedy in the Gulf led me to continue learning about fossil fuel companies, energy and the environment. I’ve since been involved in related projects like <a href="http://lostleaks.csail.mit.edu/">exposing reporting discrepancies in methane industry leak data</a>, <a href="https://xrscience.earth">communicating environmental science to activists</a>, and <a href="https://bank.green">pushing banks to adopt greener lending policies</a>.</strong></p>
