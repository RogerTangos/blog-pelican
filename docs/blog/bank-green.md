## Being good at doing good

Say you've just graduated college, bright, starry-eyed, and passionate about doing good in the world. Your first move may be to join a mission-driven organization where you'll spend a few years working on issues you care about, maybe visiting an orphanage or two, maybe surviving a burnout, and eventually deciding to get a lower-stress job that pays. At the paying job, you'll develop your professional skills and eventually begin to suspect that back in your 20s, while you did your best to, do good," you could have probably done _better_. You have a career/mortgage/kids now, and you determine that the best way for you to make a change is either to donate money to better charities or to focus on your family and the people around you. Maybe you'll pick up your word-changing dreams when you retire.

At least that's how the do-good career cycle often goes.

I spent the last decade and a half trying to reverse that cycle.[^1] Instead of jumping straight to mission-driven work, I used well-paid but often meaningless-feeling work to build my hard skills and a retirement fund, embraced a thrifty lifestyle, and only recently began doing mission-driven work.

Then, during the pandemic in 2021, with the financial means to (mostly) sustain myself and the skills to make an impact, I created a nonprofit. (It launched with [this blog post](https://bank.green/blog/cortes-climate-crisis), also by yours truly.) In 2023, I joined it full-time. In 2024, I started earning consulting fees from my co-founder's largesse, and later, a grant.

I did it! At least, the quitting-meaningless-work first part of, "it." Maybe, "it," can also count as the second part, building-a-mission-driven-org. The jury is still out on the making-actual-change third part.

Unfortunately, I've also reached an age where few of my friends talk about their work. This feels unfair since it's only recently that I've begun thinking that work is worth talking about. Moreover, discussing my work with others might lead them to point out lapses in my thinking or obvious mistakes I'm making.

Fortunately, in this email list, I have an interested audience. Here's some more about my work. I'd love your helpful pointers and suggestions, large and small. Maybe I can even inspire you to use your own life to make the change that would make your 18-year-old self proud.


[^1]: This was deliberate but also determined by extenuating circumstances including a bad financial market and a very brief post-college stint where I joined an environmental organization in a paid capacity, quickly realizing that my time there would not be well spent.


## Bank.Green as a lever, banks as a fulcrum

[Bank.Green](https://bank.green) is the organization that I co-founded. It uses technology and law to decrease fossil fuel financing, ultimately benefitting the climate. It also boasts skilled professionals (developers, designers, data scientists, marketers, accountants, and lawyers) from the global north and global south, all of who volunteer for Bank.Green because they believe it's the best use of their time.

If banks are a fulcrum for change[^2] [^3], then technology, law, and finance are all parts of a lever. And like all tools, levers often need to be assembled by pros. At Bank.Green, we're trying to build one long enough to move the world. 

[^2]: Banks are a critical point of leverage in the climate transition as they provide or underwrite much of the capital that's essential to the energy industry. Somewhere between half and 84% of all fossil fuel financing is provided by banks. The numbers are undoubtedly higher for renewable energy, as it's even more capital-intensive. 
[^3]: Insurers, pension funds, and asset managers are other fulcrums, though we're only beginning to work on insurers this year.


## What Bank.Green actually does

On the surface, Bank.Green rates banks on how climate-friendly they are and encourages consumers to switch to greener alternatives, having moved significantly more than $40 million so far.

Bank switching is an important and visible part of our work but it isn't even close to everything. Aside from bank switching, we coordinate with other groups on [media campaigns to raise awareness of fossil banks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v3gABWJhIuw), create writing campaigns for people to contact bank employees, and work with law firms, journalists, and regulators to expose when banks violate their policies.

At Bank.Green, while accountants design and execute our bank ratings methodology, software developers create interfaces to speed up the rating process, publish, and otherwise use the results. Content writers and partnership managers publicize bank ratings on social media and through partnerships. Meanwhile, data scientists use large language models to understand bank policies, allowing them to find policy breaches that are analyzed by accountants and lawyers before sometimes being passed to journalists and regulators.

Our campaigns are having a significant impact in the UK. This year, we're working to expand them to the Anglosphere, Europe, [South]East Asia, and Oceania. Other ongoing projects include statistically rigorous measurements of our impact, publishing datasets of bank sustainability data, and expanding our rating to insurance.

Though Bank.Green doesn't generate revenues, from the outside it looks more like a tech startup than a nonprofit. We have a modern website with well-designed user flows.[^4] Decisions are made in small semi-autonomous teams. And everything is always in the process of being automated.

[^4]: We don't, for example, publish comparison "league" tables buried in the middle sections of PDFs, as many other nonprofits do, a practice that I'm convinced has as much to do with a general lack of technical expertise in the space as with PDFs being an industry-standard mode of communication.

## Never ending fundraising

Fundraising, however, is a constant struggle. Awareness raising and bank switch campaigns are hard to quantify and therefore are hard to fundraise for. The first prerequisite of being a funder is having money. This often implies that funders have been successful at working within the financial system, not necessarily that they have thoughtful ideas or plans for how to change it [^5]

What's more, nonprofit funders rarely seem to understand automation. Automation often means software, and software means uncertainty and overhead.[^6]  I'm sometimes frustrated that foundations seem willing to fund armies of low-productivity interns (who perhaps remind them of their younger starry-eyed selves) but don't want to fund software that can better do those interns' jobs.

[^5]: Funders that made money in _finance_ are some of the best partners because they understand a proximal discipline. The potential funders who don't have experience in finance, law, or technology are typically the most difficult to speak with. Imagine if you were a startup company and had to explain to potential funders what hockey stick diagrams represent.
[^6]: My impression is that funders can't assess uncertainty in technology. As someone working in the field, I can safely estimate that a project, for example, our LLM automated breach monitoring project, might have a 70% chance of success with a 95% chance of producing some useful byproducts. Funders have no such certainty, so, seemingly, prefer to fund two interns to monitor one bank for one year than spend the same amount of money to fund software with an excellent chance of monitoring 60 banks for the next five years. Even worse, software development seems to count as operational overhead to many funders, further causing them to avoid it.

## Next Steps

I've worked on this project for four years. Also, during different parts of those years, I've been a full-time private sector employee, done other contract work, and been a major part of [an eco-village](./intentional-community-governance-structure.html). Bank.Green is taking a lot of time and once/if it gets more funding, it will be able to stand on its own feet. I'm now interested in switching some of my attention to other projects.

In the field of financial environmental activism, I'm interested in exploring ways to use corporate governance structures to create leverage for the energy transition. Unlike most people in the financial industry, I look at corporate governance through the lenses of technology and environmental leverage. Because I'm not financially interested, some regulations seem not to apply. What's more, unlike most of the middle-class and tame people in the nonprofit space, I'm open to taking confrontational approaches in boardroom battles.[^7] There's more leverage to be had here, and I think that with the right partners, I could play those games well.

Please do feel free to put me in touch with others whom you think might be interested.


[^7]: I've gotten some experience with another boardroom battle at my local living group. A review of boardroom battles shows that the tactics seem quite similar. That particular project is a conversation for another time.
