<h1>3. Amplifying Corporate Dissent</h1>
<p>The 2016 election and aftermath was characterized by <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2016/live-updates/general-election/real-time-updates-on-the-2016-election-voting-and-race-results/how-the-trolls-won-2016/">divisive trolling.</a> The trolls were <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/10/us/politics/russia-hacking-disinformation-election.html">sloppy</a>, <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2018/02/the-russian-conspiracy-to-commit-audience-development/553685/">cheap, and loosely affiliated</a>. They were also extremely effective at widening division and crippling the United States' political machinery.</p>
<p><strong>What happens when fossil fuel company office politics go online?</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/12/17/the-toxoplasma-of-rage/">Social Media is designed to make you angry</a>. Anger drives discussion (<a href="https://www.computing.dcu.ie/~humphrys/Turing.Test/08.chapter.html">even context-less discussion!</a>), and discussion drives views, which create clicks, which result in Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr, and other social media companies making $0.10 off of your enraged 3am keyboard-smashing. As a result, social media is an excellent place to sow division within an organization.</p>
<p>In the real world, people eventually de-escalate their anger. In social media, that circuit-breaker is jammed, because it's more profitable that way.</p>

<p><strong>What if this happened to an essential company in the fossil fuel supply chain?</strong></p>
<p>Amplifying dissent in <em>essential companies</em> within the fossil fuel value chain, can lead to sector wide slowdowns, preventing fossil fuels from being extracted and burned, while other, cleaner energy alternatives take their market share.</p>
<h3>Logistics</h3>
<p>Here's a sample to-do list to amplify corporate dissent:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Identify a fossil fuel target and topic of dissent.</strong> Companies who are essential to the fossil fuel supply chain and have ongoing scandals, difficulties, or different decisions are good candidates.</li>
<li><strong>Start two or more Facebook groups taking sides.</strong> You'll want to use separate profiles for each group.</li>
<li><strong>Create low quality memes mischaracterizing other opinions.</strong> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MemeTemplatesOfficial/">These</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MemeEconomy/">websites</a> can <a href="https://imgflip.com/memegenerator">help</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Invite employees and former employees.</strong> Employee lists can be found by searching for other company-related groups and posts. A small advertising budget (~ $50) can also go an extremely long way.</li>
<li><strong>Routinely upload new inflammatory content.</strong> Some initially posting can artificially move the discussion forward, before it moves itself.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Notes and Disclaimers</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>This might be funded by</strong> short-sellers who would benefit from a company's crack-up, or by renewable energy competitors. (Hello hedge funds and renewable energy infrastructure players!)</li>
<li>This is <strong>inspired by</strong> the Russian troll campaign which would (does?) set up protests and counter-protests on opposite sides of the street, hoping people get violent.</li>
<li><strong>I think that this is legal to <em>do</em></strong> , but might be considered stock manipulation to <em>fund</em>.</li>
<li>People are allowed to have opinions about corporate decisions.</li>
<li>Social media companies may publicly approve, but their <a href="https://qz.com/1058674/facebook-news-feed-design-and-dark-ux-are-turning-us-into-sleep-deprived-internet-addicts/">UX supports it</a>.<ul>
<li>This is similar to the many companies that<a href="https://corporate.exxonmobil.com/Energy-and-environment/Environmental-protection/Climate-change/Statements-on-Paris-climate-agreement"><em>speak</em></a> <a href="https://corporate.exxonmobil.com/Energy-and-environment/Environmental-protection/Climate-change/Statements-on-Paris-climate-agreement">in favor of anti-pollution legislation</a>, but <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_members_of_the_American_Legislative_Exchange_Council#Private_enterprise_board"><em>donate</em></a> to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Legislative_Exchange_Council#Energy_and_the_environment">groups undermining it</a>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Make sure not to slander non-public figures.</li>
<li><strong>I'm not aware of environmentalists having done this before.</strong></li>
<li>The targeted organization would need to be essential to the fossil fuel supply chain in some way</li>
<li>In targeting a company with many competitors, activists would only be replacing one minion of the climate crisis with another.</li>
<li>
<p>e.g.: Don't go after Shell, BP, or Exxon with this tactic. Instead, it's better to go after something strange, technical, and irreplaceable. I haven't looked into it much, but Halliburton might be a good option.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You may also have internet troll friends who can help.</p>
</li>
<li>I'm too earnest to be a good internet troll, so don't ask me to do this.</li>
</ul>
