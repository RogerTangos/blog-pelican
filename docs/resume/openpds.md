Summary: A distributed system to preserve user privacy while collecting and sharing data.

## Description

OpenPDS is a distributed system that allows users to collect, store, and give fine-grained access to their data while preserving their privacy. My contributions included:

- Updating the codebase to ensure compatibility with iOS 8.
- Implementing tweaks and optimizations to the existing system.

This project was developed as part of my research at MIT's CSAIL Big Data Initiative.
