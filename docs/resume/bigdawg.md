Summary: A data polystore and query system for searching across multiple database types.

## Description

BigDawg is a data polystore and associated query language that allows many different types of databases to be searched with a single query. My contributions included:

- Dockerizing various databases for deployment.
- Designing and implementing screens for a web client demo.

This project was developed as part of my research at MIT's CSAIL Big Data Initiative.
