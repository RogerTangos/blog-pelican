Summary: Predicted cargo vessels' next ports of call and arrival times.

## Description

This was a data science project and associated web API for predicting cargo vessels' next ports of call and arrival times. It achieved the following:

- Predicted vessels' next three port calls with 50% accuracy.
- Predicted port call times within a 10-hour margin in over 50% of correct predictions.

My role involved:
- Data engineering.
- Designing and testing algorithms.
- Writing a RESTful API server in Flask.

Techniques used included data interpolation, sequence generators, deep neural networks (DNNs), Markov chains, and automated ML ensembles.
