Summary: A data collaboration and sharing ecosystem developed at MIT.

## Description

DataHub is a data collaboration and sharing ecosystem. My contributions included:

- Designing and building a RESTful API.
- Implementing a row-based access control system.
- Refactoring the codebase for security and maintainability.
- Writing unit and functional tests.

This project was developed as part of my research at MIT's CSAIL Big Data Initiative. DataHub's development has since continued under the private company, Instabase.
