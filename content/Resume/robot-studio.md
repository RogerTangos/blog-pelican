Summary: A web app allowing end-users to train ML models without labeled data.

## Description

Robot Studio is a project to build a web application that allows end-users to train, create, and deploy supervised machine learning models without labeled data. My contributions included:

- Writing Kubernetes training "pods" and a command-and-control server.
- Designing a CRUX database schema.
- Contributing to the backend domain-specific language.

This project is an interesting application of weak supervision techniques.
