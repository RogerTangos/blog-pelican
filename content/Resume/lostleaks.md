Summary: Analyzed natural gas leaks in Eastern Massachusetts to identify anomalies.

## Description

LostLeaks is a data science project about natural gas leaks in Eastern Massachusetts. It compares known gas leaks to gas leak repairs, discovering that many known leaks disappear without any nearby repairs. The work has since then contributed to a 2024 court case filed by the [Conservation Law Foundation](https://www.clf.org/newsroom/gas-leaks-posing-danger-to-massachusetts-communities/).


My contributions included:

- Data sanitization.
- Location identification.
- Project management.

This was a personal interest project in collaboration with HEETMA.
