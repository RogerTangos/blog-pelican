Summary: An application for large-scale data discovery with query algebra.

## Description

Aurum is an application for large-scale data discovery with an accompanying query algebra. It can discover relationships between tables and columns in linear time. My contributions included:

- Designing and implementing syntactic sugar for the query algebra.
- Building a web client to demonstrate the application's capabilities.

This project was developed as part of my research at MIT's CSAIL Big Data Initiative.
