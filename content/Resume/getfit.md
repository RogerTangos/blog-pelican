Summary: An iOS app for motion data collection in a fitness competition.

## Description

GetFit was a yearly fitness competition for MIT faculty, staff, and students. The MIT Big Data Initiative released an iPhone application that used OpenSensing and DataHub to collect motion data (e.g., accelerometer, location). My contributions included:

- Designing and developing an iOS application for the competition.
- Reverse engineering the GetFit web API to accept data from the mobile app.

This project was developed as part of my research at MIT's CSAIL Big Data Initiative.
