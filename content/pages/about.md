Much of my environmental work was first motivated an event in the US Gulf Coast, where I grew up. There, in 2010, [BP spilled 4.9 million barrels of oil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deepwater_Horizon_oil_spill).


Cleanup workers [reported](https://www.thenation.com/article/archive/investigation-two-years-after-bp-spill-hidden-health-crisis-festers/) "eye, nose and throat irritation; respiratory problems; blood in urine, vomit and rectal bleeding; seizures; nausea and violent vomiting episodes that last for hours; skin irritation, burning and lesions; short-term memory loss and confusion; liver and kidney damage; central nervous system effects and nervous system damage; hypertension; and miscarriages". It’s no surprise, given that those unemployed fishermen were sometimes [not allowed to use respirators, and BP threatened to fire those that did](http://edition.cnn.com/2010/HEALTH/05/31/oil.spill.order/index.html). Similarly aggressive [reputation management tactics](https://www.academia.edu/12754754/BP_s_Reputation_Repair_Strategies_during_the_Gulf_Oil_Spill) by BP often kept such details off of search pages while [doctored photos](https://www.theguardian.com/media/pda/2010/jul/23/bp-oil-spill-pictures) created the illusion that BP the spill was under control.

To add insult to injury, **BP offered those same fishing families cheap settlements, which waived the families' rights to join class action lawsuits.** Often, with hungry children at home, no more livelihood on the Gulf, and no idea of what a class action lawsuit was or when it might pay them, they accepted.

**My mother translated, interpreted, and did social work for one of the Vietnamese Gulf-coast fishing communities that BP hired to clean up.** Though I had moved away for college, she shared the stories.

**Learning about the tragedy in the Gulf led me to continue learning about fossil fuel companies, energy and the environment. I’ve since been involved in related projects like [exposing reporting discrepancies in methane industry leak data](http://lostleaks.csail.mit.edu/), [communicating environmental science to activists](https://xrscience.earth), and [pushing banks to adopt greener lending policies](https://bank.green).**
